# StepStone Vendors Module 

The StepStone Vendors Module allows the display of a list of vendors by area, types and 
subtypes. Across the top is the list of areas. Select 'All' to display vendors in all areas. 
Clicking a an area other than All will display vendors in that particular area. 
 
Clicking on a vendor type will display all vendors of that type who are in currently selected 
area. This action will also display a list of vendor subtypes below the currently selected vendor 
type. Clicking on a sub type will display all vendors associated with the subtype in the selected 
area. 
 
When the name of a vendor is clicked, the user will be taken to the vendor's stream page 
where comments about the vendor are displayed. This page has a menu that includes links to 
return to the vendors page and to view the vendor rating page where the user can rate the 
vendor and see the ratings and reviews others have given the selected vendor. 
 
Vendor types and subtypes are added via the administration menu by clicking the Vendor 
Types link. The Vendor Types page display the vendor types. A new type can be added by 
clicking the Add Vendor Type button. On the Add New Type page a vendor type name can be 
added along with the font awesome icon that will be associated with the type.  
 
To find an appropriate icon, visit this page, 
https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2 type in the name of an icon to search for 
and press enter. Once a suitable icon has been found, click on the icon to go to its page. Once 
on the icon's page, click on the example HTML code displayed, such as '<i class="far fa-abacus"></i>' and this code will be copied to your device's clipboard. Go back to the Add 
New Type page and paste in the icon code into the Icon field and click the Save button. This 
will trigger a function that will strip off the everything from the HTML code except the font 
awesome class names before saving. Now the new type name and icon are ready to be 
displayed on the vendor page. 
 
To add a new subtype, edit an existing vendor type and click the Add Subtype button. Just like 
on the Add Type page, you must enter a vendor subtype name and an a font awesome icon 
and then click the Save button. 
 
Existing vendor types and subtypes can also be edit via the Vendor Types page. 
 
New vendors can be added via the Add Vendor button on the Vendors page in a space which 
opens the Add New Vendor page. On this page it is necessary to enter the vendor's (company) 
name, select a type and subtype, if a subtype is available, and the vendor contact, phone and 
email address (or website) if these items are available. Several vendor areas should also be 
selected. Always select Texas, otherwise the vendor will not show up in the list of all vendors. 
And select the local market where that vendor is available. 
 
The dashboard page includes a vendors widget which will display vendors recently added to 
the site.
